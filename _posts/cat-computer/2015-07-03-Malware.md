After working at a tech center for a while, fixing a multitude of software/hardware issues on PC's, I found that one of the biggest single issues today is the abundance of Malware and just unnecessary stuff that seems to get added to one's PC whether we want it or not.  While certainly PC's using Microsoft's operating systems weem to be the worse offenders, I am finding that Macs are increasingly being infected with Malware, particularly Adware.

Here's is my quick cleanup work process for a typical PC with Windows operating system:

  1. Run ADWCLEANER (recently purhased by Malwarebytes and available on  their website - www.malwarebytes.com)
  2. Run CCleaner (available at www.piriform.com) to remove unwanted files
  3. Check installed programs using CCleaner utilities and uninstall unnecessary programs.  Best uninstaller to use is Revo, downloaded and installed from www.ninite.com 
  3. Run MALWAREBYTES (also available for Mac) - download and install from www.ninite.com
  4. Run Super AntiSpyware to remove dangerous "cookies" -  also download and install from www.ninite.com

For Mac's, I use Malwarebytes for Mac and CCleaner for Mac.
