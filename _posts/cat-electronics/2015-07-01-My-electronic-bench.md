  I had found that my radio build projects had become increasingly conjested and took up all my desktop.  What I needed was a decent test bench that I could use for all my electronics projects.  So I decided to add an electronics bench setup to my study, adjacent to my computer desk.

  I had an old dresser that I decided to use as a base, which was 5' long and not very deep, so I set about adding a 5' x 2' 6" top which I had our local box store cut from a 3/4" ply 8' x 4' sheet, which also gave me a nice "backspash" and a couple of 9" shelves.  I bought an anti-static sheet online with the same dimensions and put everything together, adding a power strip and some LED lighting completed the project.

  Here is a photo of the final result.  As you can see its still a work in progress, but I now have somewhere to keep instruments and tools organized.
