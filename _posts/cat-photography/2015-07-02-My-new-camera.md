## Sony RX-100-V
  After working my was through a number of camera's which included a Nikon D7000 and Olympus OMD-EM1, I decided to look for a "blogging" camera that I could use to maybe prepare You-Tube videos as well as providing good still capabilities.  After a lot of looking around I was attracted to the new Sony RX-100 series which used the latest generation Sony 1" sensor.  Tis camera had rave reviews, has full 4k video caability, and looks good.  So I went ahead and bought one.

  So far I am very pleased with the results, and except for no external charger, the camera is perfect for my needs and much easier to carry around and use that the Nikon or even the Oly.  I really like its video capability and also like the viewfinder for regular still photography.  Other features I like are the rapid fire capabilities, and the flip screen.

  Here are some examples of pictures I've taken
